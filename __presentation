INTRO: 2min
 - semantic + text mining = content augmentation
 	- Combining knowledge with content
 	 	- mining
 	 	- annotation
 - What's CAM
 	- a web application and an annotation system
 	- app's features
 		- trigger annotation and display results
 		- reviewing and manually annotating 
 		- troubleshooting
 - why a UI and what the challenges are
 	- enable humans making use of the knowledge (reasoning about it)
 	- enable non-tech people reviewing the results
 	- UX & data visualization
 	- difficult task, many failed in the past
 	- it's useful but not yet usable

PROBLEM: 5min
 - old CAM
 	- Demo-only
 	- Meant to show capabilities of the API, not to be "used"
 - goals 
	- dashboard for quick overview
	- human indexer for a new market
	- cool demos, in the future, real tool

SOLUTION: DESIGN 10min
 - features and core design
 	- a pool of resources, because different sources and workflows
 	- progress
 	-
 - analyze 
 	- video 2:19
 - overview
 	- video 3:25
 - review
 	- video 4:48 (6:15 filters)
 - UX considerations

SOLUTION: IMPLEMENTATION 10min
 - web stack
 - back-end new features
 	- asynchronous indexation
 	- parallelism
 	- results caching
 	- progress tracking
 - perf 

FUTURE WORK
 (if time permits)

(backup plan)
 - full demo (recording)
 - animation as a tool
