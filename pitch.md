# Context

In an ever increasing web of data, content is quickly becoming more important than software itself. In such a scenario, companies and research groups are rushing in the quest of being the ones who manage to solve the problem of making sense of such content.
At Mondeca, a software company located in Paris, my team and I set out to approach this problem, basically facing at once two of the current challenges for the modern web.
On one hand, there's the problem of applying semantic technologies to the business world, meaning an highly controlled environment, where content needs to be enriched with corporate knowledge.
On the other hand, such a great quantity of information presents two fundamental difficulties: there's the need of a way to UNDERSTAND it, and there's the need of a tool to ACT upon this new understanding.
This was my main task: designing and developing a web application capable of addressing both needs, with a specific attention towards the usability of the product.
This project therefore belongs to two wide research areas: human-computer interaction and data visualization.

# Problem

There is an existing CAM
useful but not yet usable
challenges?
  UX / data visualization
    tough to convey information
    is an open-world technology, not as rigid as a db would be
  difficult task
    others have tried it before
    imho, they've failed
      they focused only on the technology, services
Goals
  dashboard for quick overview
  human indexer
  a real tool in the future


# Solution: how and why

Overview screen - a dashboard
  not too much info, no clutter
  9 clean widgets to give a glimpse of what's underneath
    goal -> without reading the doc, guess the content
         -> get a sense of how well the taxonomy performs
         -> speed up the review process
Review screen - the meat of the app
  targeting the human indexer
  both list and full Content
  filterable list to speed up the review process

UX considerations
  undo all the things
  feedback for most interactions
  


# Why it's important and future work
